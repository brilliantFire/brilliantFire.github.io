### RANDOM BITS
* I have seen my favorite band, Phish, 63 times in 14 different states so far. Check out the [Mockingbird Foundation](http://mbird.org/), a nonprofit organization run by Phish "phans" in support of music education!
* In addition to seeing live music, I enjoy reading, studying Spanish, and birdwatching in my spare time.
* I am a western Pennsylvania native and currently live in the Greater Boston Area with my husband, Tim, and our two cats, Jay Catsby and Nathaniel Clawthorne.
