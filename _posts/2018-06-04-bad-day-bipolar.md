It's a bad day and not the end of the world.

It *feels* like the end of the world though. Emerging from my distorted, depressed thoughts comes this overwhelming feeling of "I can't *do* this anymore." I am exhausted. It's as if I'm weighed down by lead weights in my head and body. My arms and legs feel as if they're filled with heavy sand. My stomach churns. My head aches. Even *breathing* seems harder to do. Sometimes it feels like I'm being buried alive. It makes it difficult to concentrate on anything and so I make mistakes. I miss things that are said or that I have read. My memory is shit. Everything suffers.

On bad days, I tend to hide. I close off from people and isolate myself. Not necessarily because I don't want to talk to my friends and loved ones. I do. It's just that I don't know what to say, really. So I hide. Or I lie and say I'm fine. I'm afraid of making people uncomfortable if I tell them the truth. "I have bipolar disorder and I'm having a bad day." It's actually not that hard. Except on bad days when *everything* is hard.

I also hide because I'm afraid of what I might do or say. Bad days come with a lot of paranoia. Like everyone hates me. Or I did something wrong and am just waiting to get caught. Or that everything is designed to work against me and what I want to accomplish. I'm afraid I'll react as if these things are true. Depression is self-centered like that.

It's a bad day. Or, rather, a day with a lot of symptoms. It doesn't mean I can't ever succeed in life or that every day will be like this. It doesn't mean that I'm not doing my best to take care of myself, or that my medication isn't working. You can be doing everything you can to manage your illness and still have bad days.

And yeah. *Everybody* has bad days. Regardless of whether mental illness is a part of it or not, the trick is to not make it worse by feeling bad about feeling bad.  

Because it's just a bad day and not the end of the world.
